Python API for FLIR Thermal Camera Cores

libFLIR is the open FLIR API written in Python.

It implements serial comm and UDP sockets to read/write to FLIR cores I/O. Tested to work on TAU320 Core and Linux, may work on any Python vm (yes Python is a vm).

It lets you fully control TAU320 Cores over UDP or Serial, develop nice camera control UIs using wxpython or Android UI and have all the fun.
